# Fluorocarbon

**Preserve your favorite scr on pure fluorocarbon fishing line.**

(Purpose: un-takedown-able kilo-year storage and longevity experiment. Storing 1 Byte/cm yields ~45kB on 500-yard line. That's enough to store compressed Authorship.cpp twice; plenty.)

# ALICE

**Artificially Liveborn Incremental Capacity Engineer.**

(An AI that takes 80 years to become wise just like humans except it'll take 8,000 years due to RAM outsourcing synaptic activity to the CPU. ALICE is a robot that is 2 arms and a camera on a desk, learning to play Legos and eventually, replace the coin battery on my watch.)

# Pinny

**cpp-to-real power pin interface for ALICE's motors.**

(Pinny will be realized with or without ALICE, I need a proper power signal system like the Rpi pins except not that garbage at all.)
