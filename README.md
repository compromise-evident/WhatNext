# pqML
**Train a model to recognize 18-digit primes, all models unique.**

Back to this again, I'll try a different strategy (previously ran all taining data through model, changed model, ran data through again and if less training items were misclassified, that changed model overfwrites the last.) I'm still strongly sticking to how moslty unimportant it is to train on 1 training item, see if that misclassifies the next item in line, and try a different model change if it does. This time, I'll see what happens if I train ir on 10 items, then 20, and so on.

**Purpose:**

If primes can be recognized, so might semiprimes. And if that, perhaps their factors. Desirable outcome is failure--adding to statistical proof of the inexistence of semiprime reversal shortcuts. [Old cpp from November 5 2022](https://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/59dae62225b7e270)

# EXIF_tilted

**...A small investigation into tracking-data.**

These photograph images are screenshot snippets in Geany which don't always include that noise. I believe this noise can be determined by the particular machine used to take the screenshot. REMEMBER: **this noise only shows up when I greatly tilt a high-resolution display**--almost perpendicular to the image sensor taking the photo... That's not all I'm investigating. I have noticed that while creating documents, visuals and even characters shift and render in strange ways which reproducibly makes its way to the export such as a PDF. With enough disfigurement, your document might reveal IDs of machine parts which don't get serviced often such as motherboards and even the speaker (for its resistance,) which might also be logged by the manufacturer of that machine just to match these signatures...
