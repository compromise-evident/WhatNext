**...A small investigation into tracking-data.** These photograph images are screenshot snippets in Geany which don't always include that noise. I believe this noise can be determined by the particular machine used to take the screenshot. REMEMBER: **this noise only shows up when I greatly tilt a high-resolution display**--almost perpendicular to the image sensor taking the photo... That's not all I'm investigating. I have noticed that while creating documents, visuals and even characters shift and render in strange ways which reproducibly makes its way to the export such as a PDF. With enough disfigurement, your document might reveal IDs of machine parts which don't get serviced often such as motherboards and even the speaker (for its resistance,) which might also be logged by the manufacturer of that machine just to match these signatures...
