**Preserve your favorite GitHub repo on fishing line.**

(Supports a few MB, file has footer and header on the strand so data retrieval is direction-independent. RICIN and its variants will be used for this, and some sort of micro-hammer to damage the line. Nylon is good because it's cheap, ubiquitous, and should **last forever** if protected from rays & stuff. Measuring tape seems cool for this too. Fishing line can then be heat-insulated in concrete so post-Apophis alien nerds can retrieve it when you're ash. Purpose: un-takedown-able lasting storage so the CIA will give you attention. Image: dull knife striking fishing line perpendicularly and at 45 degrees, line still holds strong. But If photoresistors are to be used, I might need a way to instead darken the line selectively. And of course, there will be a line-reader to verify the data is ready to catch fish or be stored away.)

# ALICE

**Artificially Liveborn Incremental Capacity Engineer.**

(An AI that takes 80 years to become wise just like humans except it'll take 8,000 years due to RAM outsourcing synaptic activity to the CPU. ALICE is a robot that is 2 arms and a camera on a desk, learning to play Legos and eventually, replace the coin battery on my watch.)

# Pinny

**cpp-to-real power pin interface for ALICE's motors.**

(Pinny will be realized with or without ALICE, I need a proper power signal system like the Rpi pins except not that garbage at all.)
