## Collision precision
A paper on my hash collision calculator for any file or range of files, and on generating hash without collision or reversal shortcuts. (It tells you exactly how many different files 1 hash corresponds to. And hash without collision or reversal shortcuts means variable Authorship functions with special inconvenience as you will see in the paper. Completed, electronifying...)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## compromise-emergent
The five classic cryptanalytic perspectives. (Completed, electronifying...)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Escaping finitude
The claustrophobic finitude that led me to infinite trust from 1 number. (How Authorship overcomes surprising depth of censorship. Completed, electronifying...)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Start your own crypto this instant
(Getting started with, and examples for, Authorship, AuthorshipFemto, and Hypership. Completed, electronifying...)

## RICINaux
Fast RICIN via aux cord. (Faster than feature hiding in RICINgauss but ditto illadvised. Much faster in fact. This attempt will use voltage, not "spike, flat." note2self: include new warning from gauss but direct connection.)  
**Its use in the real world:** I had personally spoken to another C++ guy, he administers acting. Apparently, just before each act, clients must register the upcoming act so that--believe it or not--the government can have sure access to this registry at all times... for some reason. He wanted a Secure Offline Machine to accept registrations from an online machine (of one-way data flow.) Now the inquiring party can physically access the offline storage and read entries. All my existing RICIN systems are enough, RICINscpa will handle massive files, and RICINaux will handle big files conveniently. This guy may choose to also upload from the offline machine (one-way data stream via RICIN.) This is the type of stuff RICIN was for.

## RICINscpa
Fast RICIN via SCPA using RTL-SDR. (Antenna to SATA data, testing unoptimized C++. Let me tell you about an unexpected security risk. C++ compiler g++ will optimize. If you have read/writes to disk interrupted by computation so that read/write appears patterned and may be picked up via side channels, you won't get what you want. Read/write will be smooth and uninterrupted. Interrupting-computation will be contiguous as well--smooth. So you have written software of certain conditions and sequence, yet the compiler modifies the program (for better, verified.) Of course the solution is to wrap those lines with the "do not optimize" braces so interruption is guaranteed. The RTL-SDR is connected to a different laptop to read. Here are some images from last time.)
