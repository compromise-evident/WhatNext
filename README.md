# LeptonKit

So the bartender says "No Leptons allowed!" A neutrino walks into the bar... Anyways, I just bought some mineral oil. I hear it emits photons upon interaction with neutrinos. If I take a metal tube that's reflective on the inside, fill it with this oil, and point it at the sun, I should get a higher photon count than if pointed away because individual particles spend more time in the oil--more time to catch particles in their phase changes perhaps. (This is my way of proving detection, and everything might fail, but at least I can publish what doesn't work.)

For the sensor, I'll try what I've built for RICINoptic since I don't plan on using false-positive trash like photon counters and modern image sensors. I'll then have C++ look through audio files as Audacity-recorded audio can be saved raw... I might have to use a lead pipe and run experiments for decades to get some numbers. Let's at least see that the oil does in the dark...

How does this tie into overkill infosec? In the future, FBI surveillance vans will use fusion-powered listening devices. And fusion can be detected by observing the rare neutrinos emitted. So maybe one day you'll walk around with a lead pipe connected to your phone and get a thermal-like visual of nearby hydrogen power supplies. (Yes this is a joke but seriously.)

# ALICE

**Artificially Liveborn Incremental Capacity Engineer.** (An AI that takes 80 years to become wise just like humans except it'll take 8,000 years due to RAM outsourcing synaptic activity to the CPU. ALICE is a robot that is 2 arms and a camera on a desk, learning to play Legos and eventually, replace the coin battery on my watch.)

# Pinny

**cpp-to-real power pin interface for ALICE's motors.** (Pinny will be realized with or without ALICE, I need a proper power signal system like the Rpi pins except not that garbage at all.)
