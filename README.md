# EXIF_tilted
**A small investigation into tracking-data.** These photograph images are screenshot snippets in Geany which don't always include that noise. I believe this noise can be determined by the particular machine used to take the screenshot. REMEMBER: **this noise only shows up when I greatly tilt a high-resolution display**--almost perpendicular to the image sensor taking the photo... That's not all I'm investigating. I have noticed that while creating documents, visuals and even characters shift and render in strange ways which reproducibly makes its way to the export such as a PDF. With enough disfigurement, your document might reveal IDs of machine parts which don't get serviced often such as motherboards and even the speaker (for its resistance,) which might be logged by the manufacturer of that machine.

# pqML
**Train a model to recognize 18-digit primes, all models unique.** Purpose: same as last time. Moving to approach: single while monitoring effect on other td.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# pqMLzero
**Natural pqML variant with activity-based gain and inactivity-based loss.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Escaping finitude
**The claustrophobic finitude that led me to infinite trust from 1 number.** (How Authorship overcomes surprising depth of censorship. Completed, electronifying...)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RICINaux
**Fast RICIN via aux cord.** (Faster than feature hiding in RICINgauss but ditto illadvised. Much faster in fact. This attempt will use voltage, not "spike, flat." note2self: include new warning from gauss but direct connection.)  
**Its use in the real world:** I had personally spoken to another C++ guy, he administers acting. Apparently, just before each act, clients must register the upcoming act so that--believe it or not--the government can have sure access to this registry at all times... for some reason. He wanted a Secure Offline Machine to accept registrations from an online machine (of one-way data flow.) Now the inquiring party can physically access the offline storage and read entries. All my existing RICIN systems are enough, RICINscpa will handle massive files, and RICINaux will handle big files conveniently. This guy may choose to also upload from the offline machine (one-way data stream via RICIN.) This is the type of stuff RICIN was for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RICINscpa
**Fast RICIN via SCPA using RTL-SDR.** (Antenna to SATA data, testing unoptimized C++. Let me tell you about an unexpected security risk. C++ compiler g++ will optimize. If you have read/writes to disk interrupted by computation so that read/write appears patterned and may be picked up via side channels, you won't get what you want. Read/write will be smooth and uninterrupted. Interrupting-computation will be contiguous as well--smooth. So you have written software of certain conditions and sequence, yet the compiler modifies the program (for better, verified.) Of course the solution is to wrap those lines with the "do not optimize" braces so interruption is guaranteed. The RTL-SDR is connected to a different laptop to read. Here are some images from last time.)

# SigEmerge
**Control computer circuitry as if antennas to network & broadcast, and pickup keystrokes using custom radios.** (This is of course to demonstrate possible capabilities, warn, and protect those born against their will. Defense only!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# groupdocOTP
**Combining groupOTP with schemeOTP.**

Yes, I scratched off leads on the keyboard guts and soldered photoresistors to those leads. IIRC there's .2V always active, and when two or more leads have an electrical path between them, some symbol is printed to the screen. So I night-moded a terminal and sent '#' flying on the screen while bringing this contraption close to the screen, where the hash characters run upwards like reverse matrix. See RICINkeyboard.cpp in Other.

# AuthorShift
**Overkill Authorship variant for switching to upon paradigm shift in computing power.**
